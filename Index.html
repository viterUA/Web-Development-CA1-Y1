    <h1>Mister Olympia</h1>

<div class = "box2">

    <p> 
        Mr. Olympia is the title awarded to the winner of the professional 
        men's bodybuilding contest at Joe Weider's Olympia Weekend - 
        an international bodybuilding competition that is held annually 
        by the International Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness (IFBB). 
        Joe Weider created the contest to enable the Mr. Universe winners 
        to continue competing and to earn money. The first Mr. Olympia was 
        held on September 18, 1965, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 
        New York City, with Larry Scott winning his first of two straight titles.
        The record number of wins is eight each by Lee Haney (1984 - 1991) 
        and Ronnie Coleman (1998 - 2005). Derek Lunsford currently holds the title.
        In addition to the Mr. Oympia title in the Open division, other male 
        divisions include the 212 division since 2012, the Men's Physique division 
        since 2013, and the Classic Physique division since 2016. The film Pumping 
        Iron (1977) featured the buildup to the 1975 Mr. Olympia in Pretoria, 
        South Africa, and helped launch the acting careers of Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
        Lou Ferrigno, and Franco Columbu. As well as the 
        Ms. Olympia title, female titles include Fitness Olympia and 
        Figure Olympia for fitness and figure competitors. All four contests occur 
        during the same weekend. From 1994 to 2003, and again in 2012, a 
        Masters Olympia was also crowned. Globally, a version with amateur 
        competitors is also presented, the Mr. Olympia Amateur.
